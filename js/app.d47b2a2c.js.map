格式化日志参数描述对象列表，增加控制显示的相关标志位\r\n *\r\n * 例如同样是 '%s' 占位符，数值和对象的展示是不一样的。再例如 Error 对象和非 Error 对象展示的内容是不同的，\r\n * 前者展示堆栈信息，后者展示对象的属性树。该函数就是为了处理这种有不同展示需求的情况。\r\n *\r\n * {\r\n *  value,            // 原始值\r\n *  placholder,       // 占位符\r\n *  displayValue,     // 展示值\r\n *  showValueDetail,  // 是否展开细节\r\n *  style             // 样式\r\n * }\r\n *\r\n * 例如 console.log('a%sc%s', 'b', {}) 的参数列表解析后如下：\r\n * [\r\n *  {value: 'a'}\r\n *  {value: 'b', placeholder: '%s'}\r\n *  {value: 'c'}\r\n *  {value: {}, placeholder: '%s'}\r\n * ]\r\n * 将上面描述对象数组进一步处理得到：\r\n * [\r\n *  {value: 'a', displayValue: 'a', placeholder: ''}\r\n *  {value: 'b', displayValue: 'b', placeholder: '%s'}\r\n *  {value: 'c', displayValue: 'c', placeholder: ''}\r\n *  {value: {}, displayValue: 'Object', placeholder: '%s'}\r\n * ]\r\n *\r\n * 观察发现：\r\n * 1）存在占位符时，value 和 displayValue 可能不同，取决于希望如何展示\r\n * 2）没有占位符时，value 和 displayValue 必然相同\r\n *\r\n * @returns {Array<Object>} 返回包含占位符描述对象的数组\r\n */\r\nfunction
